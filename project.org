    A trigger is an event that initiates an automatic transition for an object. Examples of triggers include the creation of a pull request, the rejection of a code review, and more. Send feedback on triggers.
    Caveats: Conditions, validators, and permissions will be ignored for automatic transitions. Global transitions can be automated with triggers, but please read our guide first.
